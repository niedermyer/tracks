 * This is a declarations file that'll be imported into all other stylesheets.
 *
 * This file is used to define project-wide custom variables and Bootstrap
 * variable overrides. We also use this file to define custom mixins. One of
 * the most common uses is to define the base colors for the design and then
 * redefine Bootstraps $brand-primary variable
 *
 * The @import method allows us to take advantage of variables and mixins.
